# Skyscanner Project

This repository contains a Flask-based flight searching website that I made in 2021.

This project works by taking user input to make API calls to Skyscanner, a travel agency. The information gained from these API calls are stored in an SQL database and displayed graphically on a webpage created using HTML and CSS.
