# Skyscanner Project

This repository contains a Flask-based flight searching website that I made in 2021.

This project works by taking user input to make API calls to Skyscanner, a travel agency. The information gained from these API calls are displayed graphically on a webpage created using HTML and CSS. This application also utilizes an SQL database to store information on countries supported by Skyscanner's API, their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, and their currencies.
